There are 2 sinatra apps: 

1 OAuth server: 
Start this on port 4567

# ruby server.rb

1 OAuth client:
Start this on port 4568

# ruby client.rb -p 4568

To bootstrap it all, go to http://localhost:4568/bootstrap, this will automigrate the database.
Now if you visit http://localhost:4568/, you should be able to try it out.

If you need to clear your session, visit http://localhost:4568/reset.

This is setting up the tokens between the two applications.
You will be able to try out a few cases, like reseting the database and trying to use the invalid token.
